# Week-7-IP-Hass-Consulting-Company-House-Pricing-Prediction

**Hass Consulting Company**  is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience. We have been tasked to:
 ## **Define the Question**
 
 ### a) Specifying the Question
1.   Study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. 
2.   Create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables. 

### b) Defining the Metric for Success
> Results showing the main factors that affect housing prices
> A housing prices predicition model based on the factors that affect their prices. 

### c) Understanding the context 
The dataset to use for this project can be found by following this link:
